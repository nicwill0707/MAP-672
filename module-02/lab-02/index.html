	<h1>Awesome (and convenient) map of my hometown...Lexington, KY!</h1>

    <h2>about this map</h2>
    <p>Map Authored By Nic Williamson</p>
    <!-- paragraph and list elements here -->
    </section>
    <p>Additional information about <a href="http://newmapsplus.uky.edu/">the data</a> and map goes here. Lexington is a unique city, in that it is one of the largest U.S. cities not located on a major river. So, you might be wondering, why is it here? The answer is inevitably connected to the geographic feature which defines the cultural heritage of the Bluegrass region, the former being Ordovician limestone bedrock and the latter being the raising (and racing) of Thoroughbred horses. The fertile, calcium-rich soils of the region are said to build stronger bones in horses. Of course, these facts (which you will likely read in too many history books) seem to ignore the fact that the Central Kentucky region was inhabited by people long before the arrival of Europeans and their gravitation towards strange spectator sports. Archaeological work has revealed that people have relied upon and utilized the vast fertility of Inner Bluegrass soils for thousands of years. For early peoples, the soils supported an array of plant species for foraging, fruit and nut trees, and ranging ungulates such as bison and elk.</p>
    <h3>response to Mr. Pickles</h3>
    <p>I think Pickles' article is about the "Cartographic Gaze" is similarly characterized with the experience we get when looking down at the earth from inside an airplane. In my experience, it is at such heights that we get a sense for just how drastic our imprint on the landscape really is. Two examples (from 30,000 feet) that immediately come to my mind are the quilted patchwork of agricultural fields in the Great Plains, or the congruent gridwork of U.S. suburbia. Views from above are undoubtedly accompanied with power, and also with awe and fascination throughout history. The first aerial photograph was supposedly taken by Nadar, a French photographer and balloonist of the city of Paris (where else?) in the mid-1800s. Pickles' notions have also been described by astronauts as a phenomenon known as the "overview effect" (a short documentary on the subject can be viewed on <a href="https://vimeo.com/55073825">Vimeo here</a>). I don't know for certain, but I feel as though the "Cartographic Gaze" can give one a sense of order over the landscape. The map above is a prime example, which shows my hometown and some of the major human built features which are located there. Still, as we read in the Floating Sheep Manifesto, we know that these are but abstractions of the world we tangibly interact with everyday.</p>
