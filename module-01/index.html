<h1>My Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h1>
<p>I enjoyed reading this piece, as it highlights many of the challenges inherent in authoring maps. With how often we rely on maps in our week-to-week existence, it would do us well to remember how "all maps lie" (FSM #2a) in that their representation of the world is always incomplete, imperfect, and/or distorted (FSM #6b). The set of ideas laid out here are a useful reference for us to consider as we delve ever so deeper into the world of web programming and online mapping. After all, we are the ones in pursuit of acquiring the skill, or power, to map.</p>
<p>One notion mentioned in the article which I feel may be worth extra consideration is the idea of the “democratization of cartography.” I must agree with the suggestion that, even though web mapping is becoming increasingly accessible, for many there still are and will always be insurmountable barriers to entry. One essential barrier is of course the glowing screen upon which I type this paper, and the wireless signals and fiber optic cables which will carry my homework to its intended location. The danger of course, is that by simply calling this lack of computer and internet access a barrier to entry, we are saying that those without are somehow deficient.</p>
<p>I think we (humans) sometimes pursue technology like a moth pursues flame, not really understanding why (or if) we really need it. I like the fact that this article asks us to take some time to contemplate how this is manifested (pun intended) in the world of digital mapping.</p>
