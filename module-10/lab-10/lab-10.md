# Lab 10: Finishing your New Maps Plus Portfolio

For this lab, complete the instructions detailed in Lesson 10 and submit the URL to Canvas by the due date (Dec 18th). Include at least three maps, 1.) a static one produced in MAP671, 2.) one linked to a CARTO hosted map, and 2.) one of the maps produced here in MAP672.

Have fun with the design of the portfolio, and customize it with your own colors and typefaces.
